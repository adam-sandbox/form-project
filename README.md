# Notes

## Overview

- React as primary UI library
- Using `create-react-app` for scaffold/build
- Custom hook for reusable form logic
- CSS modules for styling
- Basic responsive layout
- Immutable data
- Storybook for component library (`yarn storybook`)

## Note

- App displays multiple `Form` instances, just to demonstrate the ability to configure unqiue fields, completely isolated form state etc

- Using `create-react-app` un-ejected for simplicity... didn't focus on any file cleanup

- https://reqres.in for test form submission, as the suggested API at http://dummy.restapiexample.com was unavailable

## Improvements

- More robust validation (utilise external dep)
- Nicer styling, more polish, animation etc
- More extensive test coverage
